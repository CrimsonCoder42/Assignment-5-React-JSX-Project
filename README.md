Summary

Use React JSX to create a React app

Task:

You are tasked with creating a simple guessing game. 

Game play:

The user will guess a number and the game will tell them if they are too high, too low, or correct. 

Track the total number of guesses needed.  

Use a separate “page” (route) for user settings:  

 number of guesses allowed  
 number range to guess – i.e., 1 – 100.

Use a separate “page” (route) for player stats:

 # guessed correctly
 Average number of guesses needed  

Additional features are encouraged once the requirements are met.

Deliverables: 

Zip file with all code such that we can run using create-react-app (export a component called GuessApp)
